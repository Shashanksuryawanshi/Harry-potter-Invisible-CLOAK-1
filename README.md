# 🧙‍♂️ Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV

Disappear like Harry Potter using a real-time webcam invisibility cloak built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **KMeans Clustering**!

This project captures the background and replaces the pixels of a cloak (detected by color) with that background, creating an invisibility effect.
